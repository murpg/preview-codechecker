# Preview-of-CodeChecker for Adobe ColdFusion
This is a demo that I will be doing for the forked tool that the Ortus Solutions team helped develop.   
A shout out to Chris Weller's, who created the first version of the CodeChecker https://github.com/wellercs/CodeChecker   

## Two flavors of CodeChecker:  

1. CodeChecker app   
2. CodeChecker CLI tool  

The Ortus Solutions versions of CodeChecker can best be used if it is managed by CommandBox. For those of you who do not know what CommandBox is I strongly suggest that you check it out. Here is a link to the CommandBox book.
